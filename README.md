# Makers Software Development Bootcamp JS Fundamentals

This is a collection of working materials from the Makers Software Development Bootcamp JS Fundamentals module.
It is not a single app but the code resulting from a series of exercises and challenges that can be seen in the [Makers Academy course repository](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-fundamentals/blob/main/README.md).
